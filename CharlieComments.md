## Runtime

Your work is in the **CongressAddress** folder.

I cannot iterate through records, backward and forwards.

You display only a few records and did not seem to get **GetAddress** working fully.

I can switch between components with the menu. It is not properly styled.

In **SmallNumbers**, you provide a view of  numbers. You might have added a few more.

You have refactored into:

- Address.js
- AddressShow.js
- AddressChanger
- AddressEdit
- ElfHeader
- ElfMenu
- SmallNumbers

You have good casing. As suggested, your React components are in files that begin with a capital letter.

The following directories exist:

- \_\_tests\_\_
- components
- css
- images

Smaller Issues

- **address-list.js** exists
- **index.js** is properly implemented
- Your code doest not run without errors or warnings.
- You do a good job of formatting your code.

## Testing

You have 44 working tests and they are refactored into  4 **modules**, at least approximately one per component.

You are using the Enzyme debug statements.

## Get Address

Get Address is working fairly well but needs a few tweaks and is not fully integrated into **CongressAddress**.
